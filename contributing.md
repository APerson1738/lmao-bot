# Contribution guide

The "lmao-bot" repository provides code that runs lmao-bot on Discord, duh.

If you're interested in contributing to this project, great! This file should help you get started.

## Types of contribution

There are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:

-   **Create a brand-new feature:** maybe you want some sort of "ban everyone" command?
-   **Fix a bug:** we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/DrEngi/lmao-bot/issues),
    or maybe you found your own.


## Setup

To contribute and test, you need a text editor, git, a GitHub account, python 3.6.5, and you'll need to install the requirements listed in https://github.com/DrEngi/lmao-bot/blob/master/requirements.txt.
If you want to work with music or voice, please ensure that [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is installed on your machine.

As far as text/code editors go, there are more editors than you can shake a stick at, so it's down to personal preference. [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a great, open source editor we can definitely recommend (and one of us uses it).

For more information on setting up Git on your machine, [read this article](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

With the above dependencies satisfied, [create your new account on Github](https://github.com/join).

You'll need to [install Python 3.6.5 for your operating system]https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/).

### Fork and clone

Next up, you need to fork and clone the repo to be able to contribute to it. You can [learn about forking on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Once you have your own fork, [clone it to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

Finally, change into the new directory created by the clone and run the following command to install dependencies 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure that you have all the required development modules installed to build your contributions. You are now ready to contribute.

Once you're satisfied, [submit your pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Please be sure you create a pull request to the DEVELOP branch, not Master. Direct PRs to Master will be denied.
