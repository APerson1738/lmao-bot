Guild mute command
Mute list + ban list
Fix unmute glitch described in https://discordapp.com/channels/407274897350328345/461312988540829717/470635373161086977
    Idea to fix: create a dictionary of "muted_until" with each guild as a key and a list of muted members and times they should be unmuted as a value
    If asyncio.sleep expires and time >= muted_until, unmute user
    If asyncio.sleep expires and time < muted_until (due to multiple mutes being in place), don't unmute user
    If user is ever unmuted, change muted_until to current time
Import emojis from another guild (lmao-bot guild)
